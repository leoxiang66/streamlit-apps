Abstract,domain
"Distilled self-supervised models have shown competitive performance and efficiency in recent years. However, there is a lack of experience in jointly distilling multiple self-supervised speech models. In our work, we performed Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (EKD) on various self-supervised speech models such as HuBERT, RobustHuBERT, and WavLM. We tried two different aggregation techniques, layerwise-average and layerwise-concatenation, to the representations of different teacher models and found that the former was more effective. On top of that, we proposed a multiple prediction head method for student models to predict different layer outputs of multiple teacher models simultaneously. The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of the distilled models on four downstream speech processing tasks, Phoneme Recognition, Speaker Identification, Emotion Recognition, and Automatic Speech Recognition in the hidden-set track of the SUPERB benchmark.",nlp
"This paper presents a novel optimization framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the aim of reducing hallucinations produced by an ASR model. The proposed framework optimizes the ASR model to maximize an expected factual consistency score between ASR hypotheses and ground-truth transcriptions, where the factual consistency score is computed by a separately trained estimator. Experimental results using the AMI meeting corpus and the VoxPopuli corpus show that the ASR model trained with the proposed framework generates ASR hypotheses that have significantly higher consistency scores with ground-truth transcriptions while maintaining the word error rates close to those of cross entropy-trained ASR models. Furthermore, it is shown that training the ASR models with the proposed framework improves the speech summarization quality as measured by the factual consistency of meeting conversation summaries generated by a large language model.",nlp
"The recent progress in text-based audio retrieval was largely propelled by the release of suitable datasets. Since the manual creation of such datasets is a laborious task, obtaining data from online resources can be a cheap solution to create large-scale datasets. We study the recently proposed SoundDesc benchmark dataset, which was automatically sourced from the BBC Sound Effects web page. In our analysis, we find that SoundDesc contains several duplicates that cause leakage of training data to the evaluation data. This data leakage ultimately leads to overly optimistic retrieval performance estimates in previous benchmarks. We propose new training, validation, and testing splits for the dataset that we make available online. To avoid weak contamination of the test data, we pool audio files that share similar recording setups. In our experiments, we find that the new splits serve as a more challenging benchmark.",nlp
"Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have extended the usability of speech technologies to a wide variety of languages. With how many languages these models have to handle, however, a key to understanding their imbalanced performance across different languages is to examine if the model actually knows which language it should transcribe. In this paper, we introduce our work on improving performance on FLEURS, a 102-language open ASR benchmark, by conditioning the entire model on language identity (LID). We investigate techniques inspired from recent Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) studies to help the model handle the large number of languages, conditioning on the LID predictions of auxiliary tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique over standard CTC/Attention-based hybrid mod- els. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art systems using self-supervised models with the Conformer architecture improve over the results of prior work on FLEURS by a relative 28.4% CER. Trained models are reproducible recipes are available at https://github.com/ espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/fleurs/asr1.",nlp
"Pre-trained Transformer models such as BERT have shown great success in a wide range of applications, but at the cost of substantial increases in model complexity. Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a promising method to lower the implementation cost and energy consumption. However, aggressive quantization below 2-bit causes considerable accuracy degradation due to unstable convergence, especially when the downstream dataset is not abundant. This work proposes a proactive knowledge distillation method called Teacher Intervention (TI) for fast converging QAT of ultra-low precision pre-trained Transformers. TI intervenes layer-wise signal propagation with the intact signal from the teacher to remove the interference of propagated quantization errors, smoothing loss surface of QAT and expediting the convergence. Furthermore, we propose a gradual intervention mechanism to stabilize the recovery of subsections of Transformer layers from quantization. The proposed schemes enable fast convergence of QAT and improve the model accuracy regardless of the diverse characteristics of downstream fine-tuning tasks. We demonstrate that TI consistently achieves superior accuracy with significantly lower fine-tuning iterations on well-known Transformers of natural language processing as well as computer vision compared to the state-of-the-art QAT methods.",nlp
"We present ProsAudit, a benchmark in English to assess structural prosodic knowledge in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models. It consists of two subtasks, their corresponding metrics, an evaluation dataset. In the protosyntax task, the model must correctly identify strong versus weak prosodic boundaries. In the lexical task, the model needs to correctly distinguish between pauses inserted between words and within words. We also provide human evaluation scores on this benchmark. We evaluated a series of SSL models and found that they were all able to perform above chance on both tasks, even when trained on an unseen language. However, non-native models performed significantly worse than native ones on the lexical task, highlighting the importance of lexical knowledge in this task. We also found a clear effect of size with models trained on more data performing better in the two subtasks.",nlp
"The increasing reliability of automatic speech recognition has proliferated its everyday use. However, for research purposes, it is often unclear which model one should choose for a task, particularly if there is a requirement for speed as well as accuracy. In this paper, we systematically evaluate six speech recognizers using metrics including word error rate, latency, and the number of updates to already recognized words on English test data, as well as propose and compare two methods for streaming audio into recognizers for incremental recognition. We further propose Revokes per Second as a new metric for evaluating incremental recognition and demonstrate that it provides insights into overall model performance. We find that, generally, local recognizers are faster and require fewer updates than cloud-based recognizers. Finally, we find Meta's Wav2Vec model to be the fastest, and find Mozilla's DeepSpeech model to be the most stable in its predictions.",nlp
"Deep neural network based speech enhancement technique focuses on learning a noisy-to-clean transformation supervised by paired training data. However, the task-specific evaluation metric (e.g., PESQ) is usually non-differentiable and can not be directly constructed in the training criteria. This mismatch between the training objective and evaluation metric likely results in sub-optimal performance. To alleviate it, we propose a metric-oriented speech enhancement method (MOSE), which leverages the recent advances in the diffusion probabilistic model and integrates a metric-oriented training strategy into its reverse process. Specifically, we design an actor-critic based framework that considers the evaluation metric as a posterior reward, thus guiding the reverse process to the metric-increasing direction. The experimental results demonstrate that MOSE obviously benefits from metric-oriented training and surpasses the generative baselines in terms of all evaluation metrics.",nlp

"Deep neural network based speech enhancement approaches aim to learn a noisy-to-clean transformation using a supervised learning paradigm. However, such a trained-well transformation is vulnerable to unseen noises that are not included in training set. In this work, we focus on the unsupervised noise adaptation problem in speech enhancement, where the ground truth of target domain data is completely unavailable. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial network based method to efficiently learn a converse clean-to-noisy transformation using a few minutes of unpaired target domain data. Then this transformation is utilized to generate sufficient simulated data for domain adaptation of the enhancement model. Experimental results show that our method effectively mitigates the domain mismatch between training and test sets, and surpasses the best baseline by a large margin.",audio
"Monaural speech enhancement has been widely studied using real networks in the time-frequency (TF) domain. However, the input and the target are naturally complex-valued in the TF domain, a fully complex network is highly desirable for effectively learning the feature representation and modelling the sequence in the complex domain. Moreover, phase, an important factor for perceptual quality of speech, has been proved learnable together with magnitude from noisy speech using complex masking or complex spectral mapping. Many recent studies focus on either complex masking or complex spectral mapping, ignoring their performance boundaries. To address above issues, we propose a fully complex dual-path dual-decoder conformer network (D2Former) using joint complex masking and complex spectral mapping for monaural speech enhancement. In D2Former, we extend the conformer network into the complex domain and form a dual-path complex TF self-attention architecture for effectively modelling the complex-valued TF sequence. We further boost the TF feature representation in the encoder and the decoders using a dual-path learning structure by exploiting complex dilated convolutions on time dependency and complex feedforward sequential memory networks (CFSMN) for frequency recurrence. In addition, we improve the performance boundaries of complex masking and complex spectral mapping by combining the strengths of the two training targets into a joint-learning framework. As a consequence, D2Former takes fully advantages of the complex-valued operations, the dual-path processing, and the joint-training targets. Compared to the previous models, D2Former achieves state-of-the-art results on the VoiceBank+Demand benchmark with the smallest model size of 0.87M parameters.",audio
"Transformer based models have provided significant performance improvements in monaural speech separation. However, there is still a performance gap compared to a recent proposed upper bound. The major limitation of the current dual-path Transformer models is the inefficient modelling of long-range elemental interactions and local feature patterns. In this work, we achieve the upper bound by proposing a gated single-head transformer architecture with convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, named \textit{MossFormer} (\textit{Mo}naural \textit{s}peech \textit{s}eparation Trans\textit{Former}). To effectively solve the indirect elemental interactions across chunks in the dual-path architecture, MossFormer employs a joint local and global self-attention architecture that simultaneously performs a full-computation self-attention on local chunks and a linearised low-cost self-attention over the full sequence. The joint attention enables MossFormer model full-sequence elemental interaction directly. In addition, we employ a powerful attentive gating mechanism with simplified single-head self-attentions. Besides the attentive long-range modelling, we also augment MossFormer with convolutions for the position-wise local pattern modelling. As a consequence, MossFormer significantly outperforms the previous models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on WSJ0-2/3mix and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks. Our model achieves the SI-SDRi upper bound of 21.2 dB on WSJ0-3mix and only 0.3 dB below the upper bound of 23.1 dB on WSJ0-2mix.",audio
"In this work, we propose a frequency bin-wise method to estimate the single-channel speech presence probability (SPP) with multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Since all frequency bins are typically considered simultaneously as input features for conventional DNN-based SPP estimators, high model complexity is inevitable. To reduce the model complexity and the requirements on the training data, we take a single frequency bin and some of its neighboring frequency bins into account to train separate gate recurrent units. In addition, the noisy speech and the a posteriori probability SPP representation are used to train our model. The experiments were performed on the Deep Noise Suppression challenge dataset. The experimental results show that the speech detection accuracy can be improved when we employ the frequency bin-wise model. Finally, we also demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art SPP estimation methods in terms of speech detection accuracy and model complexity.",audio
"In this study, we present an approach to train a single speech enhancement network that can perform both personalized and non-personalized speech enhancement. This is achieved by incorporating a frame-wise conditioning input that specifies the type of enhancement output. To improve the quality of the enhanced output and mitigate oversuppression, we experiment with re-weighting frames by the presence or absence of speech activity and applying augmentations to speaker embeddings. By training under a multi-task learning setting, we empirically show that the proposed unified model obtains promising results on both personalized and non-personalized speech enhancement benchmarks and reaches similar performance to models that are trained specialized for either task. The strong performance of the proposed method demonstrates that the unified model is a more economical alternative compared to keeping separate task-specific models during inference.",audio
"Speech utterances recorded under differing conditions exhibit varying degrees of confidence in their embedding estimates, i.e., uncertainty, even if they are extracted using the same neural network. This paper aims to incorporate the uncertainty estimate produced in the xi-vector network front-end with a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) back-end scoring for speaker verification. To achieve this we derive a posterior covariance matrix, which measures the uncertainty, from the frame-wise precisions to the embedding space. We propose a log-likelihood ratio function for the PLDA scoring with the uncertainty propagation. We also propose to replace the length normalization pre-processing technique with a length scaling technique for the application of uncertainty propagation in the back-end. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb-1, SITW test sets as well as a domain-mismatched CNCeleb1-E set show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques with 14.5%-41.3% EER reductions and 4.6%-25.3% minDCF reductions.",audio

"Conventional methods for speaker diarization involve windowing an audio file into short segments to extract speaker embeddings, followed by an unsupervised clustering of the embeddings. This multi-step approach generates speaker assignments for each segment. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised HierArchical gRaph Clustering algorithm (SHARC) for speaker diarization where we introduce a hierarchical structure using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform supervised clustering. The supervision allows the model to update the representations and directly improve the clustering performance, thus enabling a single-step approach for diarization. In the proposed work, the input segment embeddings are treated as nodes of a graph with the edge weights corresponding to the similarity scores between the nodes. We also propose an approach to jointly update the embedding extractor and the GNN model to perform end-to-end speaker diarization (E2E-SHARC). During inference, the hierarchical clustering is performed using node densities and edge existence probabilities to merge the segments until convergence. In the diarization experiments, we illustrate that the proposed E2E-SHARC approach achieves 53% and 44% relative improvements over the baseline systems on benchmark datasets like AMI and Voxconverse, respectively.",audio
"Voice conversion (VC) techniques can be abused by malicious parties to transform their audios to sound like a target speaker, making it hard for a human being or a speaker verification/identification system to trace the source speaker. In this paper, we make the first attempt to restore the source voiceprint from audios synthesized by voice conversion methods with high credit. However, unveiling the features of the source speaker from a converted audio is challenging since the voice conversion operation intends to disentangle the original features and infuse the features of the target speaker. To fulfill our goal, we develop Revelio, a representation learning model, which learns to effectively extract the voiceprint of the source speaker from converted audio samples. We equip Revelio with a carefully-designed differential rectification algorithm to eliminate the influence of the target speaker by removing the representation component that is parallel to the voiceprint of the target speaker. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the capability of Revelio in restoring voiceprint from audios converted by VQVC, VQVC+, AGAIN, and BNE. The experiments verify that Revelio is able to rebuild voiceprints that can be traced to the source speaker by speaker verification and identification systems. Revelio also exhibits robust performance under inter-gender conversion, unseen languages, and telephony networks.",audio

"Conventional methods for speaker diarization involve windowing an audio file into short segments to extract speaker embeddings, followed by an unsupervised clustering of the embeddings. This multi-step approach generates speaker assignments for each segment. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised HierArchical gRaph Clustering algorithm (SHARC) for speaker diarization where we introduce a hierarchical structure using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform supervised clustering. The supervision allows the model to update the representations and directly improve the clustering performance, thus enabling a single-step approach for diarization. In the proposed work, the input segment embeddings are treated as nodes of a graph with the edge weights corresponding to the similarity scores between the nodes. We also propose an approach to jointly update the embedding extractor and the GNN model to perform end-to-end speaker diarization (E2E-SHARC). During inference, the hierarchical clustering is performed using node densities and edge existence probabilities to merge the segments until convergence. In the diarization experiments, we illustrate that the proposed E2E-SHARC approach achieves 53% and 44% relative improvements over the baseline systems on benchmark datasets like AMI and Voxconverse, respectively.",audio
"Voice conversion (VC) techniques can be abused by malicious parties to transform their audios to sound like a target speaker, making it hard for a human being or a speaker verification/identification system to trace the source speaker. In this paper, we make the first attempt to restore the source voiceprint from audios synthesized by voice conversion methods with high credit. However, unveiling the features of the source speaker from a converted audio is challenging since the voice conversion operation intends to disentangle the original features and infuse the features of the target speaker. To fulfill our goal, we develop Revelio, a representation learning model, which learns to effectively extract the voiceprint of the source speaker from converted audio samples. We equip Revelio with a carefully-designed differential rectification algorithm to eliminate the influence of the target speaker by removing the representation component that is parallel to the voiceprint of the target speaker. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the capability of Revelio in restoring voiceprint from audios converted by VQVC, VQVC+, AGAIN, and BNE. The experiments verify that Revelio is able to rebuild voiceprints that can be traced to the source speaker by speaker verification and identification systems. Revelio also exhibits robust performance under inter-gender conversion, unseen languages, and telephony networks.",audio
"The recent progress in text-based audio retrieval was largely propelled by the release of suitable datasets. Since the manual creation of such datasets is a laborious task, obtaining data from online resources can be a cheap solution to create large-scale datasets. We study the recently proposed SoundDesc benchmark dataset, which was automatically sourced from the BBC Sound Effects web page. In our analysis, we find that SoundDesc contains several duplicates that cause leakage of training data to the evaluation data. This data leakage ultimately leads to overly optimistic retrieval performance estimates in previous benchmarks. We propose new training, validation, and testing splits for the dataset that we make available online. To avoid weak contamination of the test data, we pool audio files that share similar recording setups. In our experiments, we find that the new splits serve as a more challenging benchmark.",audio
"Existing deep learning based speech enhancement (SE) methods either use blind end-to-end training or explicitly incorporate speaker embedding or phonetic information into the SE network to enhance speech quality. In this paper, we perceive speech and noises as different types of sound events and propose an event-based query method for SE. Specifically, representative speech embeddings that can discriminate speech with noises are first pre-trained with the sound event detection (SED) task. The embeddings are then clustered into fixed golden speech queries to assist the SE network to enhance the speech from noisy audio. The golden speech queries can be obtained offline and generalizable to different SE datasets and networks. Therefore, little extra complexity is introduced and no enrollment is needed for each speaker. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields significant gains compared with baselines and the golden queries are well generalized to different datasets.",audio
"Stuttering is a neuro-developmental speech impairment characterized by uncontrolled utterances (interjections) and core behaviors (blocks, repetitions, and prolongations), and is caused by the failure of speech sensorimotors. Due to its complex nature, stuttering detection (SD) is a difficult task. If detected at an early stage, it could facilitate speech therapists to observe and rectify the speech patterns of persons who stutter (PWS). The stuttered speech of PWS is usually available in limited amounts and is highly imbalanced. To this end, we address the class imbalance problem in the SD domain via a multibranching (MB) scheme and by weighting the contribution of classes in the overall loss function, resulting in a huge improvement in stuttering classes on the SEP-28k dataset over the baseline (StutterNet). To tackle data scarcity, we investigate the effectiveness of data augmentation on top of a multi-branched training scheme. The augmented training outperforms the MB StutterNet (clean) by a relative margin of 4.18% in macro F1-score (F1). In addition, we propose a multi-contextual (MC) StutterNet, which exploits different contexts of the stuttered speech, resulting in an overall improvement of 4.48% in F 1 over the single context based MB StutterNet. Finally, we have shown that applying data augmentation in the cross-corpora scenario can improve the overall SD performance by a relative margin of 13.23% in F1 over the clean training.",audio
"Visual speech (i.e., lip motion) is highly related to auditory speech due to the co-occurrence and synchronization in speech production. This paper investigates this correlation and proposes a cross-modal speech co-learning paradigm. The primary motivation of our cross-modal co-learning method is modeling one modality aided by exploiting knowledge from another modality. Specifically, two cross-modal boosters are introduced based on an audio-visual pseudo-siamese structure to learn the modality-transformed correlation. Inside each booster, a max-feature-map embedded Transformer variant is proposed for modality alignment and enhanced feature generation. The network is co-learned both from scratch and with pretrained models. Experimental results on the LRSLip3, GridLip, LomGridLip, and VoxLip datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 60% and 20% average relative performance improvement over independently trained audio-only/visual-only and baseline fusion systems, respectively.",audio
"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) usually suffers from performance degradation when applied to a new domain due to domain shift. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve the performance on the unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from the source to the target domain. To improve transferability, existing UDA approaches mainly focus on matching the distributions of the source and target domains globally and/or locally, while ignoring the model discriminability. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA approach for ASR via inter-domain MAtching and intra-domain DIscrimination (MADI), which improves the model transferability by fine-grained inter-domain matching and discriminability by intra-domain contrastive discrimination simultaneously. Evaluations on the Libri-Adapt dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. MADI reduces the relative word error rate (WER) on cross-device and cross-environment ASR by 17.7% and 22.8%, respectively.",audio
"We previously proposed contextual spelling correction (CSC) to correct the output of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with contextual information such as name, place, etc. Although CSC has achieved reasonable improvement in the biasing problem, there are still two drawbacks for further accuracy improvement. First, due to information limitation in text only hypothesis or weak performance of ASR model on rare domains, the CSC model may fail to correct phrases with similar pronunciation or anti-context cases where all biasing phrases are not present in the utterance. Second, there is a discrepancy between the training and inference of CSC. The bias list in training is randomly selected but in inference there may be more similarity between ground truth phrase and other phrases. To solve above limitations, in this paper we propose an improved non-autoregressive (NAR) spelling correction model for contextual biasing in E2E neural transducer-based ASR systems to improve the previous CSC model from two perspectives: Firstly, we incorporate acoustics information with an external attention as well as text hypotheses into CSC to better distinguish target phrase from dissimilar or irrelevant phrases. Secondly, we design a semantic aware data augmentation schema in training phrase to reduce the mismatch between training and inference to further boost the biasing accuracy. Experiments show that the improved method outperforms the baseline ASR+Biasing system by as much as 20.3% relative name recall gain and achieves stable improvement compared to the previous CSC method over different bias list name coverage ratio.",audio
"Speaker diarization is a task to label an audio or video recording with the identity of the speaker at each given time stamp. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning framework to conduct real-time multi-speaker diarization and recognition without prior registration and pretraining in a fully online and reinforcement learning setting. Our framework combines embedding extraction, clustering, and resegmentation into the same problem as an online decision-making problem. We discuss practical considerations and advanced techniques such as the offline reinforcement learning, semi-supervision, and domain adaptation to address the challenges of limited training data and out-of-distribution environments. Our approach considers speaker diarization as a fully online learning problem of the speaker recognition task, where the agent receives no pretraining from any training set before deployment, and learns to detect speaker identity on the fly through reward feedbacks. The paradigm of the reinforcement learning approach to speaker diarization presents an adaptive, lightweight, and generalizable system that is useful for multi-user teleconferences, where many people might come and go without extensive pre-registration ahead of time. Lastly, we provide a desktop application that uses our proposed approach as a proof of concept. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to apply a reinforcement learning approach to the speaker diarization task.",audio
"Visual speech recognition models extract visual features in a hierarchical manner. At the lower level, there is a visual front-end with a limited temporal receptive field that processes the raw pixels depicting the lips or faces. At the higher level, there is an encoder that attends to the embeddings produced by the front-end over a large temporal receptive field. Previous work has focused on improving the visual front-end of the model to extract more useful features for speech recognition. Surprisingly, our work shows that complex visual front-ends are not necessary. Instead of allocating resources to a sophisticated visual front-end, we find that a linear visual front-end paired with a larger Conformer encoder results in lower latency, more efficient memory usage, and improved WER performance. We achieve a new state-of-the-art of $12.8\%$ WER for visual speech recognition on the TED LRS3 dataset, which rivals the performance of audio-only models from just four years ago.",audio
"Speech enhancement (SE) is proved effective in reducing noise from noisy speech signals for downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR), where multi-task learning strategy is employed to jointly optimize these two tasks. However, the enhanced speech learned by SE objective may not always yield good ASR results. From the optimization view, there sometimes exists interference between the gradients of SE and ASR tasks, which could hinder the multi-task learning and finally lead to sub-optimal ASR performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach called gradient remedy (GR) to solve interference between task gradients in noise-robust speech recognition, from perspectives of both angle and magnitude. Specifically, we first project the SE task's gradient onto a dynamic surface that is at acute angle to ASR gradient, in order to remove the conflict between them and assist in ASR optimization. Furthermore, we adaptively rescale the magnitude of two gradients to prevent the dominant ASR task from being misled by SE gradient. Experimental results show that the proposed approach well resolves the gradient interference and achieves relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 9.3% and 11.1% over multi-task learning baseline, on RATS and CHiME-4 datasets, respectively.

"A study is presented in which a contrastive learning approach is used to extract low-dimensional representations of the acoustic environment from single-channel, reverberant speech signals. Convolution of room impulse responses (RIRs) with anechoic source signals is leveraged as a data augmentation technique that offers considerable flexibility in the design of the upstream task. We evaluate the embeddings across three different downstream tasks, which include the regression of acoustic parameters reverberation time RT60 and clarity index C50, and the classification into small and large rooms. We demonstrate that the learned representations generalize well to unseen data and achieve similar performance compared to a fully supervised baseline.",audio
"Word-piece models (WPMs) are commonly used subword units in state-of-the-art end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. For multilingual ASR, due to the differences in written scripts across languages, multilingual WPMs bring the challenges of having overly large output layers and scaling to more languages. In this work, we propose a universal monolingual output layer (UML) to address such problems. Instead of one output node for only one WPM, UML re-associates each output node with multiple WPMs, one for each language, and results in a smaller monolingual output layer shared across languages. Consequently, the UML enables to switch in the interpretation of each output node depending on the language of the input speech. Experimental results on an 11-language voice search task demonstrated the feasibility of using UML for high-quality and high-efficiency multilingual streaming ASR.",audio
"Recent studies in neural network-based monaural speech separation (SS) have achieved a remarkable success thanks to increasing ability of long sequence modeling. However, they would degrade significantly when put under realistic noisy conditions, as the background noise could be mistaken for speaker's speech and thus interfere with the separated sources. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel network to unify speech enhancement and separation with gradient modulation to improve noise-robustness. Specifically, we first build a unified network by combining speech enhancement (SE) and separation modules, with multi-task learning for optimization, where SE is supervised by parallel clean mixture to reduce noise for downstream speech separation. Furthermore, in order to avoid suppressing valid speaker information when reducing noise, we propose a gradient modulation (GM) strategy to harmonize the SE and SS tasks from optimization view. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on large-scale Libri2Mix- and Libri3Mix-noisy datasets, with SI-SNRi results of 16.0 dB and 15.8 dB respectively.
